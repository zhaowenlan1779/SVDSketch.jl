The matrix sketch only reflects the most important features of A (up to a tolerance), which enables faster calculation of the SVD of large matrices compared to using svds.\n\nThe sketch of A satisfies that U Sigma V^T - A_F  A_F leq texttol. The default value for tol is eps(eltype(A))^(1/4).\n\nIn addition to the SVD, the vector apxerror is returned, whose entries represent the relative approximation error in each iteration, U Sigma V^T - A_F  A_F. The length of apxerror is equal to the number of iterations, and apxerror[end] is the relative approximation error of the output.\n\nOptions\n\nmaxrank: The rank of the matrix sketch will not exceed maxrank. The default value is minimum(size(A)).\n\nblocksize: A larger value reduces the number of needed iterations, but might also result in the result having higher rank than necessary to achieve convergence. The default value is min(max(floor(Integer, 0.1*size(A, 1)), 5), maxrank).\n\nmaxiter: The maximum number of iterations for the algorithm. The default value is maxrank รท blocksize.\n\npoweriter: The number of power iterations performed within each iteration of the algorithm. Power iterations improve the orthogonality of the U and V outputs. The default value is 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
