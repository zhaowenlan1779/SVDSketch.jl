# SVDSketch

[![Build Status](https://github.com/zhaowenlan1779/SVDSketch.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/zhaowenlan1779/SVDSketch.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This work is led by the [THU-numbda](https://github.com/THU-numbda) group, and based on the [farPCA](https://github.com/THU-numbda/farPCA) project.

This is a Julia implementation of the `svdsketch` function from Matlab, based on
[an improved version](https://github.com/THU-numbda/farPCA/tree/main) of the original algorithm.
